/**
 * Change recovery account operation

 * Each account lists another account as their recovery account.

 * an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account
 * during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an
 * owner authority is valid for recovery purposes.
 *
 * On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of
 * the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction)
 * or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery
 * has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover
 * request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account
 * of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as
 * witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted
 * witness according to stake.
 *
 * Example
 * ```js
 * var operation = [
 *   'change_recovery_account',
 *   {
 *     account_to_recover: 'alice',
 *     new_recovery_account: 'steem',

 * In the event of a dispute the *agent* can divide the funds between the to/from account.
 * Disputes can be raised any time before or on the dispute deadline time, after the escrow
 * has been approved by all parties.
 *
 * This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the *agent* and *to* must
 * agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the escrow.
 *
 * The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to the escrow agent
 * to determine the fee.
 *
 * Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by 'from' and 'escrow_id', the 'escrow_id' is defined
 * by the sender.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * var ratification = new Date(Date.now() + 60*60*1000).toISOString().slice(0, -5)

/**
 * Recover account operation
 * -------------------------
 * Recover an account to a new authority using a previous authority and verification
 * of the recovery account as proof of identity. This operation can only succeed
 * if there was a recovery request sent by the account's recover account.
 *
 * In order to recover the account, the account holder must provide proof
 * of past ownership and proof of identity to the recovery account. Being able
 * to satisfy an owner authority that was used in the past 30 days is sufficient
 * to prove past ownership. The get_owner_history function in the database API
 * returns past owner authorities that are valid for account recovery.
 *
 * Proving identity is an off chain contract between the account holder and
 * the recovery account. The recovery request contains a new authority which
 * must be satisfied by the account holder to regain control. The actual process
 * of verifying authority may become complicated, but that is an application
 * level concern, not a blockchain concern.
 *
 * This operation requires both the past and future owner authorities in the
 * operation because neither of them can be derived from the current chain state.
 * The operation must be signed by keys that satisfy both the new owner authority
 * and the recent owner authority. Failing either fails the operation entirely.
 *
 * If a recovery request was made inadvertantly, the account holder should
 * contact the recovery account to have the request deleted.
 *
 * The two setp combination of the account recovery request and recover is
 * safe because the recovery account never has access to secrets of the account
 * to recover. They simply act as an on chain endorsement of off chain identity.
 * In other systems, a fork would be required to enforce such off chain state.
 * Additionally, an account cannot be permanently recovered to the wrong account.
 * While any owner authority from the past 30 days can be used, including a compromised
 * authority, the account can be continually recovered until the recovery account
 * is confident a combination of uncompromised authorities were used to
 * recover the account. The actual process of verifying authority may become
 * complicated, but that is an application level concern, not the blockchain's
 * concern.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * var operation = [
 *   'recover_account',
 *   {
 *     account_to_recover: 'alice'
 *     new_owner_authority: {
 *       weight_threshold: 1,

 * There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time.
 * Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has
 * an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority
 * and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block

 * Set withdraw vesting route operation
 * ------------------------------------
 * Allows an account to setup a vesting withdraw but with the additional
 * request for the funds to be transferred directly to another account's
 * balance rather than the withdrawing account. In addition, those funds
 * can be immediately vested again, circumventing the conversion from
 * vests to steem and back, guaranteeing they maintain their value.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```js
 * var operation = [
 *   'set_withdraw_vesting_route',
 *   {
 *     from_account: 'alice',
 *     to_account: 'alice2',
 *     percent: 10000,
 *     auto_vest: false
 *   }
 * ]
 * ```
